src/routes/user.route.js - receives all requests to the /v1/users endpoint. Sends the request to the validation middleware 

src/validations/user.validation.js - defines request schema in the getUser() method. Request url param has to be a string and a valid Mongo ID 

src/controllers/user.controller.js - getUser() method is called if request validation passes. Uses the service layer to fetch the user data for the requested id value 

src/services/user.service.js - getUserById() method utilizes the User model defined to fetch data from MongoDB

How would MongoDB behave in the below scenarios?

Mongoose schema has less fields than the data already present in Mongo and you try to read some data (eg: using a GET request). Will it throw an error or you get back a subset of the Mongo document data according with only the fields defined in the schema? 

You need to create a new document in Mongo (eg: using a POST request) but you pass a parameter to the Model.create() method with a field in the Mongoose schema missing. Will it throw an error or create a document with null value for the missing field? Is there any difference if the required or default properties are set for the missing field? 

Check the src/services/user.service.js file. You’ll find that the User model is imported using the statement below 


const { User } = require("../models"); 

How is the User model available when src/models is imported rather than src/models/user.model.js? 
Why didn’t we just use a single file to add all the functionalities required to make an endpoint work? Wouldn’t that be possible or does Node.js mandate such a structure? 

What can happen if you don’t validate the input request before it gets to the later layers? 

Try commenting out the validation layer and hitting the GET /v1/users/:userId endpoint with a non-valid MongoID 
MongoDB is a NoSQL database. Its documents support a flexible schema. Are we overriding this behaviour by using Mongoose to enforce a particular schema?
The route handler for GET /v1/users/:userId calls the validate middleware as its first callback function and then the user controller method. What happens if the validate middleware 
throw an error 
pass an error object as parameter to the next() method 
call the next() method

if mongoose.model() has collection's name as the 1st param then where do we specify the name of the db 
in the db url present in the env file  as MONGODB_URL= mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/qkart which is the db name   
From which of the following MongoDB collections will a Mongoose model created with the given statement interact with? *
mongoose.model("Topic", topicSchema) 
Mongoose automatically looks for the plural, lowercase version of your model name . ' . ANS is topics ALSO BELOW 
https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html
You can also find out how to provide a collection name explicitly by passing an additional parameter to the model() method call https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html
When u create a doc without the address field defined in the schema of the model .                 the document gets created without the address field 
But when the same field is skipped which had  the required property set to true                        error is thrown and the field is set to some explicitly defined default value  
GO THROUGH THIS LINK FOR CRUD via MONGOOSE object relational mapping lib BUT BEFORE THAT  keep this in mind that u can perform these operations only on a

Which of the following are valid ways to find the document from MongoDB using the document’s unique email field? (Here, "User" is a Mongoose model and “email” a valid email as string) *
User.findOne({ "email" : email })  
User.findOne({ email: email })  
User.findOne({ email })   
How do you add a static function to a Mongoose model? (Here, "User" is a Mongoose model and “hasNonEmptyAddress” the static function to be added) *  
User.statics.hasNonEmptyAddress = function(arg1, arg2...) {}
User.static(‘hasNonEmptyAddress’, function(arg1, arg2...) {})

What is a process object 
process is a global object in Node.js and can be used from any module without requiring it. It can be used for purposes like reading environment variables using the process.env object, for example, 
process.env.port. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-process-object-explained/  
In the context of the QKart app, which of the following statements will return the value of the "PORT" variable stored in the “.env” file? *  
// import src/config/config.js  
const config = require("./config/config");  
// stores "PORT" value from .env  
const port = <statement>;  
Correct Answer :  
process.env.PORT  
config.port  
Answer Explanation : 
process.env stores the key as what’s present in the .env file which is PORT=8082. Hence, use process.env.PORT to access its value  
config.js file exports the environment variable, PORT read from process.env explicitly as port. So, we can also use config.port to get the value. 
We used it to access the environment variables set in the .env file from src/config/config.js. These are loaded to the process.env object using the dotenv library.  
How are you able to access the values stored in the ".env" file by importing the “src/config/config.js” file? (Eg: “PORT” is accessible via “config.port”) *  
  
Hide explanation   
Answer Explanation :   
The "src/config/config.js" file uses the dotenv npm library to load variables stored in “.env” file as fields of the application’s process.env object.  
dotenv.config({ path: path.join(__dirname, '../../.env') });   
These values are then exported from the file.   
module.exports = {  
  env: envVars.NODE_ENV,
  port: envVars.PORT,
}

How to configure the Joi schema in "src/config/config.js" to allow for more environment variables than that’s checked in the schema i.e, apart from (NODE_ENV, PORT, MONGODB_URL) *
Use Joi’s Object.unknown() method
Use Joi’s Object.unknown(true) method
Why should the Joi schema be defined for the "params" field of request for the “GET /v1/users/:userId” endpoint? *
Answer Explanation :
The validation is for the userId field in the "GET /v1/users/:userId" request. Here, userId is a request url param value. We use req.params to access it in Express.
The src/middlewares/validate.js middleware matches fields in the Joi schema with that in the req object. So, to specify the schema is for the req.params field, the schema properties are set on the params field.
Similarly, to validate request body available via req.body, use
const schema = {
  body: Joi.object().keys({
    bodyFieldName: <properties>;
  }),
};

Which of the following are valid ways to set the "name" field of a Mongoose schema to type “String” inside the mongoose.Schema() constructor? *
name: String
name: { type: String }
I used the import state given below for importing a function from another module in my project. Which of the following export statements if used in "service.js" will call the actual function correctly? (“service.js” and “home.js” are two separate files) * freeService() exists within service.js file and it has been exported as servive=require("./service").freeService and then 
called as service() options are  
exports.freeService = freeService;
module.exports.freeService = freeService
module.exports = [freeService: freeService)
module.exports = freeService
ANS 
module.exports.freeService = freeService
module.exports = { freeService: freeService }
Answer Explanation :
If you export using module.exports = freeService, you’ll have to use the below import statement to correctly import the function
const service = require(‘./service’);
differences are module.exports and exports https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-module-exports-exports-node-js/
Which of the following are correct ways to import the "freeService" function to another file in the same folder as “service.js”? * inside service.js has freeService
// File: service.js
function freeService() {
	console.log("free!");
}
function paidService() {
	console.log("paid :("));
}
module.exports = {
	freeService,
	paidService
}
OPTIONS 
const freeService = require('./service').freeService
const {freeService} = require("./service')
const services = require( service); const freeService = services freeService
const (service) = require('./service')
ANS 
const freeService = require(‘./service’).freeService
const { freeService } = require(‘./service’)
const services = require(‘./service’); const freeService = services.freeService;
FOLLOW THIS LINK BELOW in capitals 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import
what happens when home.js file is called 
// File: service.js
function freeService() {
	console.log("free!");
}
function paidService() {
	console.log("paid :(");
}
module.exports.freeService = freeService;
module.exports = paidService;
// File: home.js
const service = require(‘./service’).freeService
service()
ANS 
Prints "freel
O Prints "undefined"
Error is thrown due to importing a non-existent object
Error is thrown due to service being undefined and calling it

MOD 2
You’ll start with creating auth tokens and then move on to using it to authenticate requests. You can use the user sign up endpoint, /v1/auth/register to create a new token for the user along with creating a User model object. This token will be sent to the user with the response which then can be used to authenticate secured endpoints.

The default entry point for a node application is index.js(defualt)
Separate file for mongoose connection and for handling requests from the front-end index.js and app.js in order 2 distinguish between these requests PLUS helps 2 assist testing ALSO there's  a possibility that
if one file is used than consequently we will be targeting the same original DB server BOTH FOR TESTING AND request handling which can cause unwanted addition,deletion,manipulation of data . ' . a test DB should be considered which can b achieved by having 
separate files PLUS there's a node package called supertest(searchItUp purpose) which uses an express app as an arg 4 the request method like this
const res = await request(app).post("/v1/auth/register").send(newUser);

challenges This is interesting i can consider the latest entry for schema validation by means of the this keyword 

userSchema.statics.isEmailTaken = async function (email) {//pay attention to the way we have a static () inside the schema ALTHOUGH check below
  const user = await this.findOne({email});
  return user;
};

const animalSchema = new Schema({ name: String, type: String },
{
  // Assign a function to the "statics" object of our animalSchema through schema options.
  // By following this approach, there is no need to create a separate TS type to define the type of the statics functions. 
  statics: {
    findByName(name) {
      return this.find({ name: new RegExp(name, 'i') });
    }
  }
});

A Date instance created with Date(arg) will always return current (today's) date.In other words the args are ignored Date('any-random-argument') is an alias for new Date() The missing  piece is the new keyword:   new Date(dateString)

BUGS for GO LANG FIBER PROJECT QKART FIBER 
Look for problems one can come across while working with go routines since 
1 .  U've used them in service files 
2 . Can convince the interviewer that u know something about the Go Lang's X FACTOR  

BUGS 
consider this implementation of addProductToCart - // it uses catchAsync  
. ' . if it is removed before using this solution and a request is triggerred from PostMan I saw the error that Product does't exist means 
request was pretty much received by the server , its just this () is async therefore error needs to be passed on to the next middleware to notice 
the JSON error on the frontend   
const addProductToCart = async (req, res, next) => { 
  try { .addProductToCart( 
      req.user, 
      req.body.productId, 
      req.body.quantity 
    ); 
    res.status(httpStatus.CREATED).send(cart);
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);
  }
};
. ' . we use catchAsync as it serves the same try-catch purpose , only difference being it uses a Promise.catch() syntex to do that 
function catchAsync(fn) {
  return function(req, res, next) {
    Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch((err) => next(err));
  }
}

Consider this as a challenge Since bloating/crowding of the file will happen anyway be it a controller or some service file(Although will be a service file) - 
Solution -  encapsulating ()s present within a single wrapper (obj )  present within a given service file to ensure default export plus accessing these ()s with dot separator   
after instantiating the imported class

yes i had seen that i couldn't access the body of the POST request url as sent from the front-end within my server's index.js  , because it was not in the 
json format , (was rather text ??!). ' . used another middleware which was express.json() --> app.use(express.json()) 
i was thinking of fetching those  records/documents from my MongoDB 's dataBase (MyDB's collection myTodos) whose startDate and endDate lied within the range specified by the user in the front-end 
which n turn will still be a GET request BUT it will require this data range to passed to the back-end so that i could be considered while fetching data from the DB  

HOW TO DEBUG 
Upon coming across errors including functions look if the parameters were ALL used or not . Are u introducing something new that does not have any concerns with the params ? If yes are they globally available ?

INTERVIEW   QUESTIONS 


Encoding : En - coding or converting the given code into some other format essentially speaking it is nothing but 
representing the given data of some existing format into some other format by transforming it utilizing some publically(private under development??) available scheme  .
This new format is achieved by performing transformation on the given sequence of characters/symbols/numbers/specialCharacters that we have via schemes like   
And the idea behind encoding is to impart compatibility to given a piece of code cause what is coding the opposite of en-coding where code is still readable 2 a developer but it needs to be
compiled into machine readable format in order to be understandable to the machine too .   No key is required
Encryption : A key is required 4 converting the data into some other format .
Hashing : refers to the process of using a hashing algorithm on a given data so that it becomes far more complex than its original format . Is totally un-readable 
However , hackers can 

User authentication : 
(i)Cockie based user authentication : old cockie approach involves performing validations on the submitted form and  creating a session with the DB . This DB responds with a session ID which is stored in the 
coockie jar of the browser() This coockie jar is the place where  confedential data is stored in the form of key-value format  which is used for every http request made from the browser to the desired 
server by the xyz user . The user then can receive data available from the server .That is to say we have a STATEFUL session between the server and the client 
This data stored in the coockie called the session id remains active for specific duration only but it can turn in-active ur activity on the webSite falls down i.e. 2 say if ur inactive on a website ur session id
consequently ends up being in-active . WebSites like FB have long lived sessions whereas banks have shorter ones(like 5min)
However CSRF can be an issue in this case cause attackers can point users to a target server prompting them to perform actions which they don't want 2 such as making payments/changing passwords(modern
frameworks such as flask&jango reduces this risk)
another problem includes storage of the session-Id in some in-memory DB or local DB . In production where Horizontal DB scaling occurs  this seems to be problematic cause of the bottleneck situation
(ii) JOT based authentication : Here instead of the session-ID a JsonWebToken is created .This token contains a private key from the DB and is stored locally in the browser . On future requests to the server
this JOT is added in the authorization header prefixed by bearer. Thus the server just needs to validate the signature present on the auth header which in turn cuts the need to look-up for some storage source 

Module 2 ->v1 : new version comes but we want to keep v1 intact i-> have different router  
app.use("/v2",newRoute)
model is the midium of communication 
UNLIKE the SIGNATURE (private) the header & payload are de-codable via a base64 decoder
we cannot tamper the token which makes it authentic and therefore there's no need to rely on some third party storage since the data itself is sufficiently true and authenticated(single source of truth) AND THEREFORE 
they are stateless (NO NEED 2 STORE?) So we keep a check at the backend if the user logs-out the token expires/removed  
one task at a time services unit testing 
bussiness logic within controllers integration testing
Testing : May be we can call it as the process which is undertaken in order to ensure the expected behavior of the software
unit of code : smallest possible code commodity 
function : set of instructions or collection of units of code 
module : set of functions 
only : test case is operated alone rest are neglected  
not : negation 
testing depending on network calls 
beforeAll>beforeEach(or beforeEachTestCase)>afterEach>afterAll
testable code refers to the one which produces static output irrespective of the environment 
  let currentTime = new Date();   
    let hr = currentTime.getHours();
    console.log(hr)
    if(hr < 12) {
        return "morning";
    }
    if(hr < 16) {
        return "afternoon";
    }
    if(hr > 16) {
        return "evening";
    }
instead 
it('Verify that 15 returns afternoon', () => {
        const mockDate = new Date(2021, 3, 24, 15, 0, 30, 0)

        // Create a system spy...NEW
        const spy = jest.spyOn(global, 'Date');
        spy.mockImplementationOnce(() => mockDate);
        
        let output = functions.whatTimeIsIt();

        expect(output).toEqual('afternoon');
        // Check if the spy was called
        expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    });
However afterEach and beforeEach can run at the start/end of every test case 

Passport  : a NodeJS package which serves as a middleware required for performing authentication specific to some strategy(jwt strategy , facebook strategy)
new version would be better (so new documentation lookups and maintenance)

{$in: arr}: This is a MongoDB query expression. It checks whether the value of the contentRating field is in the array arr. 

Putting it all together, the expression obj.contentRating = {$in: arr} is updating the contentRating field in the MongoDB document (obj). The new value assigned to contentRating is an object that uses the $in operator to match any value in the specified array (arr).  
  
const arr = ["PG", "PG-13", "R"]; 
const filter = { _id: ObjectId("your_document_id") };

CAREER GAP :
resume -  I had dedicated my career gap to intensive learning and skill development in critical 
areas of the tech industry, including backend development, cloud computing, and container 
orchestration. This period allowed me to gain knwoledge in languages like JavaScript ,Go Lang ,YAML etc, 
along with their relevant frameworks, and to complete several projects that demonstrate my capabilities. 
I acquired substantial knowledge in AWS cloud services, focusing on designing, deploying, 
and managing 
scalable applications. 
Additionally, I learnt containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes, 
which enable effective management of microservices architectures and 
seamless application deployment and scaling
____________________________________________________________________
MUST INCLUDE 
i We were not taught Go lang or YAML back in clg - 
  But then why yaml ? --> Human readable , docker-compose.yml file but then their are alternatives too such as lang specific docker clients   
  I gained my interest when I landed on the 
  github handle of these technologies docker n k8s and saw that the language distribution stated that 
  go lang was used intensively for developing them up.
ii Containerized application spinning on cloud and orchestrated through 
  o Bare metal vs Vms vs containers 
  o Need for orchtestration - compose vs swarm vs k8s  
It took time to gain clarity towards all this besides giving it shape and face in the form of projects was quite time consuming too so yes that't the reason why my career gap was valuable in some sense 
INTV ans - I spent my career gap focused on educating myself and enhancing my skills in the technology field. This included learning how to code in areas like the 
backend, cloud computing, and container 
orchestration. By doing this, I gained some new stuff in terms of languages for the backend such like Javascript ,Go Lang ,YAML etc and their corresponding frameworks and was able to work on various projects that showcase what I can do. 
I have learned in-depth about AWS cloud services, which includes designing, deploying, and managing 
of scalable applications. 
So, I had got hands experience on containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes, 
which is a way to manage microservices architectures and 
has the potential to be implemented in different areas, like in case of applications that require 
to be expanded and to adapt to different usage scenarios
OR may be - 
My career break or sabbatical as you would prefer to call it, I reserved it for intensive training and skill building in key areas
technological areas such as backend development, cloud computing, and container technology.
Orchestration is what i was involved in during that time. That period gave me a chance to pick up on languages such as JavaScript ,Go Lang ,YAML etc,
ogether with the relevant frameworks that accompany them, and finishing some projects that will show my abilities is all that I ask for in return.
I am now well grounded in AWS cloud technology with a bias towards implementation of and not just using the solutions.
and managing
scalable applications.
Thanks to this, I had a chance to get acquaintance with Docker and Kubernetes, the most popular containerization and orchestrations tools.
which enable effective management of microservices architectures and
seamless application deployment and scaling

Bcrypt.js salting/hashing algorithem reason behind having it instead of encryption , encoding etc 
Rainbow table attack can be tackled with salting 
Enhanced security and user experience for authentication by implementing secure user authentication using Passport.js with the JWT strategy for token-based authorization, reducing 
 server storage requirements for session data by 70% and providing a seamless user experience for login and signup. 
Question -  how is it that data stored within a jwt token consumes 70% of the data in the session storage  
Server session storage is a mechanism for maintaining user state across multiple requests in a web application. It holds data that is necessary for the application to manage user interactions, authentication, and other features 
Types of data it can hold  
o Auth data  : sessionId (unique identifier for the session) user credentials , session tokens 
  timeStamps , ip addresses 
o Application state : 
      Current page state (data 2 maintain state across multiple req -> paginated list or multi-step from progress)
      Navigation data : not present in my project (inform)
o Temporary data : Cart Data(list<ProductId>before checkOut) , partially filled payment form like a partially filled process(not in my project) but what if internet went away in the middle  
o Anti-CSRF tokens 

Understanding Data Storage in JWT Tokens vs. Server Session Storage
To explain how data stored in a JWT token can lead to a 70% reduction in server session storage requirements, we need to understand what gets stored in both JWTs and server sessions, and how this impacts the storage requirements.

How JWT Tokens Work
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact and self-contained way to represent information between two parties. Here's a breakdown of how JWTs reduce the need for server-side session storage:

Structure of a JWT Token:

Header: Contains metadata about the token, like the type of token and the signing algorithm.
Payload: Contains the claims or user data, like user ID, email, roles, and other information.
Signature: Used to verify that the token has not been tampered with.
Example JWT Payload:

JWT Token Storage:

JWTs are stored on the client-side (typically in local storage or cookies) and are sent with every request.
How JWT Reduces Server Storage
When you use JWTs for authentication, you store the following data on the client side rather than the server side:

User Data:

JWT Payload: Includes essential user information and claims like user ID, email, roles.
Example: Instead of storing user ID and email in the session on the server, you encode these into the JWT.
Session Metadata:

JWT Header and Signature: The token's metadata and signature ensure the token's integrity and authenticity, which do not need to be stored on the server.
Example Comparison of Data Storage
Here’s a simplified example to show how JWT can handle data versus server sessions:

Server Session Storage
Data Stored	Example Content	Size Estimate
  Session ID	sessionId:1234567890	16 bytes
  User ID	userId: user123	8 bytes
  User Email	email: johndoe@example.com	20 bytes
  User Roles	roles: [user]	10 bytes
  Token Metadata	creation time, expiration	24 bytes
  Total Storage per User	78 bytes	
  JWT Token
  Data Stored	Example Content	Size Estimate
  User ID	"sub": "user123"	16 bytes
  User Email	"email": "johndoe@example.com"	20 bytes
  User Roles	"roles": ["user"]	10 bytes
  Token Metadata	header and signature (encoded)	30 bytes
  Total Storage	76 bytes	
Why JWT Tokens Reduce Server Storage by 70%
When you use JWTs, you eliminate the need for storing user-specific session data on the server. Here’s how it reduces server storage:
Client-Side Storage:
JWTs: Store user data (ID, email, roles) and metadata in the token itself. This data is managed client-side and included in each request.
Server-Side Storage:
Sessions: Requires storage for session metadata, user data, and often additional mechanisms to handle state and security.
Illustrative Example:
Storage Type	JWT Storage	Server Session Storage
User Data Size	30 bytes (in JWT)	34 bytes (stored server-side)
Session Metadata	Included in Token	Additional storage required
Data Stored:
JWT Token: Combines multiple pieces of information (user ID, email, roles, and metadata) into a single token sent with each request.
Server Session Storage: Must maintain separate entries for each piece of data and metadata.
By moving user data and session metadata to the JWT, you reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored on the server, which can represent a 70% reduction in storage if the server was previously storing similar data.

 1 of deci - Improved deployment efficiency and reduced operational issues by utilizing Docker to containerize application components, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production, reducing deployment time by 50% and decreasing compatibility and configuration-related issues by 80%.
  Reason/Logic :   
      Compatibility Issues:
          Dependency Conflicts: Different environments may have different versions of libraries, frameworks, or dependencies, leading to conflicts.
          Operating System Differences: Variations in OS configurations and versions can cause applications to behave differently or fail to run.
          Configuration Inconsistencies:

          Environment Variables: Differences in environment variable configurations between development, testing, and production environments.
          File Paths and Permissions: Inconsistent file paths or permission settings that can cause issues.
          Deployment Inconsistencies:

          Script Differences: Different deployment scripts or processes used in different environments can lead to errors or inconsistencies.
          Manual Steps: Manual steps in deployment processes that can introduce human error.
          Coupling Issues:

          Tight Coupling: High interdependence between different parts of the application, making it difficult to deploy and manage individual components independently.
Monolithic Architecture: Monolithic applications where changes in one part of the system can affect other parts, making deployment more complex.
By using Docker, you encapsulate the application and its dependencies into a container, which ensures that it runs consistently across different environments. This means the same container can be used in development, testing, and production, thereby eliminating many of the issues related to environmental differences.
 - Microservices : 
 Microservices : 
User Service: Handles user authentication, profile management, and user-related data.
News Service: Fetches and processes news data from various APIs and serves it to the frontend.
Media Service: Manages media assets, such as images and videos, associated with news articles.
Notification Service: Sends notifications to users about new articles, updates, or other events.
Analytics Service: Tracks user behavior, article views, and other analytics data.
Using Fiber and Go Kit
You can indeed use both Fiber and Go Kit in your Golang project. Here’s how:

Fiber: This can be used as the web framework for handling HTTP requests, serving static files, and providing a user-friendly interface for your microservices.
Go Kit: This can be used for creating and managing the business logic of your microservices, providing a structured way to implement microservices with clear separation of concerns.

backup n recovery strategies (4 ur postgres db) 

CHALLENGES 
o db because I wanted to have this mapping b/t read more clicks and userId clicking them  
data retention/presistence within postGres db inside of a pod's container 
My project shouldl be installed locally after getting git cloned for that having simple information like port information 
regiseter , login and news blog page have different routes and ports too (4 development purposes)
if routes are served by microservices then how to route traffic to them b/t dev n deployment -> Solution reverse proxy 
troubleshooting with dev of mvc vs deployment of mvc 
.env for each microservice or still at the root 
if Dockerfile and minfest file for each mvc then configMap n secret 4 each 2 ? Well not really it should be centralized for better project management 
Same went for air and go-kit package for each mvc or at root alone ?? we know what we did 
godotenv -> Viper 
port 3000 for each but for dev 3001,3002, 5432 <-db 

My PostGres db url was required to establish connection b/t fiber server n db_url env variable 
But 4 that will have to run postGres deployment.yml since  k8s doesn't support .env files the way docker does 
. ' . configMaps n secrets 
BESIDES was working with microservices . ' . Was severly doubtful that should each microservice have its own .env files or not , separate Dockerfiles or should they be independent individual go projects itself (all true though)

PROJECT README 
o first concerned .env -> global/central ConfigMap.yml n secet.yml 
o may be the reverse proxy should be at the root main.go file 
o run the internal/db -> db.go 

TODO    
no viper+configMap since its non-confedential- 4 one data i.e. port an entire .env file   


o which microservices should be given access to db ??   
DON'T read those which r seemingly tough 
ReverseProxy <-> handlers <-> auth middlewares 
o internal/db shall be used to connect with postgres db however what all CRUD operations can we have   
o What all actions can it be to initiate a CRUD operation ?? fetchUserSpecificNews -> newsId into userId newsCollections ??   
o if containers within EC2 then where does AWS EkS comes into picture ??  
o We shall use ELB/ALB for load balancing or Eks 
o 1-> News blog page acc to mediaStack 2-> Register / Login Page (diff title n creative headings for each , diff color too may be. CSS animations ??  ) 
Meaning of $(echo -n "postgres://user:password@postgres:5432/newsdb?sslmode=disable" | base64)   
  API_TOKEN: $(echo -n "your_api_token" | base64)    
o failed to render : template does not exist     
o ind: Secret -> ingress for database service for database ? Required for all microservices ?? purpose the way we have pvc.yml   
o is the above serving the DB_HOST in .env ??  Or else will it be localhost ??  
o if yes then where shall the db_url be used from .env ??  
o why db.go auth.go files within internal don't have api-specific routes ? Why do they have cmd like appearance   
o client n secret for twitter , google and slack will I have to do this for login , sing  
o is it necessarry to push my container image to Dockerhub ?? as seen in the lines container name: news-service image :   
o AWS deployment demands changes in file n content names ?? main.go -> app.go ??

LEARNT   
microservices :   
o each shall be inidividual go lagn projects having respective .env files unless there are k8s manifest files involved   
o common practise to have containers inside of vms in aws since apps will have an extra layer of isolation provided by AWS EC2 instances. 
Pod and Service Creation:

A Pod running the PostgreSQL container is created.
Typically, a Service is also created to expose PostgreSQL to other Pods within the Kubernetes cluster.
Cluster Port vs. Host Port:

Kubernetes Port: The PostgreSQL service in Kubernetes operates on a port defined within the cluster (e.g., 5432), but this is an internal port within the Kubernetes network.
Host Port: Unless explicitly configured to expose the PostgreSQL service to the host machine's port (e.g., using NodePort or LoadBalancer type services), the PostgreSQL instance will not be directly accessible via the host machine's 5432 port.

DOUBTS NEW NOTES:   
kubectl vs kind  
go get vs go instatll    
defer res.Body.Close()    
k8s mainfest file : type: Opaque    
Node is a simple phyical or virutal machine   
A pod is the smallest deployable unit within k8s arch which serves as an abstraction for the respective container runtime of the container it has within i.e. pods make these containers agnostic of of their respective runtimes(containerD,podman may b).  
Pods may end up consuming lot of host machine resources(ram,memory,storage,network,etc) if plenty of containers are present inside of it   
. ' . at most one container per pod or closely related side cars are advised to have   
What does k8s do ? Manage containers ; which are present inside of pods is what both of these kinds of manifests do -> manage pods based on container specification   
k8s creates this pod layer on top of our containers which is compatible with all the container run times that exist out there   
k8s offers a virtual network which assigns an ip(always unique) to every pod within the k8s arch   
These pods are ephemeral since they can die easily so the previous ip gets replaced by a new one as taken by the newly provisioned pod as part of self healing    
We don't want to keep track of these changing ip addresses . ' . ingress and service   
pods communicate with each other over a service(which are urls containing ip of pod services . service section of manifest files)  
These service urls are usulaly present inside of the built up and running application  
If this service name is changed then essentially u will have to re-build the application followed by pushing it to the repository then pull that image into the pod followed by re-starting the pod too   
configMaps store external configuration information of our application such as app/db urls  
This map is expected to be present inside of the manifest file of the corresponding pod(doubtful if manifest files speak to pods or do they define pods) which are expected to have the requirement of this application configuration data  
as present inside of the config map  
Advantage is that if u change the endpoint of the application service u just need to manipulate the config map n ur good to go ; u can avoid buiding a new container image pushing it to remote container repository -> pulling it to pod then restarting  
u can avoid doing all this   
However a part of this application external configuration data can also be db userName , db name n user password and keeping this information in the form of plainText within the config map can be Insecure . ' .   
NEW : kubernetes working with stateful data which is required to be presisted is quite cumbersome. Stateful applications r the 1s which store data n keeps track of the state of this stored data      
VOLUMES : when we do not want the data present within the pod's containers to be lost when we re-start it we use volumes which help in persisting them .This proves to be helpful when data is required to be kept preserved as seen in case of   
  databases when running inside of pod containers.The Volume component attaches a physical stroage like a hardrive to the pod which can be present either in the local machine which serves as the host for k8s     
secrets within k8s is also in the form of key-value pairs BUT they are NOT plain text instead they r BASE 64 encoded  4 ex - dbPass = somethingHidden2  
we want this secret to be present in the pod which can be done by means of a secretVolume present inside the volume list of the pod   
This volume can be mounted to a dedicated path/directory 4 ex - /certs/  
Stateless apps are deployed using kind: Deployment whereas Stateful are depoyed using kind: StatefulSet  
k8s doesn't support env files the same way Docker does . ' . use configMaps(for data app shall need) n Secrets(data that should remain hidden db passwords) to manage configuration data

    Concerning Currents n news Api by placing the API key in the URL allows you to authenticate your requests and fetch specific results dynamically based  
    on user input from the frontend. The API key is a unique identifier that allows the API service to track and limit your usage according to the plan you have signed up for. 
User Input: The user enters a keyword or query in the frontend. 
Fetch Data: Your JavaScript code constructs a URL with the user input and your API key. 
API Request: The constructed URL is used to make an API request to fetch data.  
Display Results: The fetched data is processed and displayed in the frontend.

UPDATES :   
  onion folder architecture pros n cons in a comparitive manner thereby xyz   
  EITHER    
    have Yaml as part and keep below as update an Google Remote Procudure Call for communication between containers   
  OR   
    go through https://www.crio.do/projects/docker-kubernetes-intro-git/ since it has bring it on FOR EACH section   
    PENDING DOUBT view all objects in a namespace(isolated environment/space) cause we know what c groups do they restrict resource usage   
    o Using a YAML specification file isn't the only way to create objects in Kubernetes. Find out what imperative and declarative methods mean, here. Try creating an object using the imperative method.  
    o Pods aren't the only objects that you can deploy on Kubernetes. Find out about more options that you have, here. Create a deployment object which runs your application inside a pod. 
    Look for certain possible updates concerning k8s since we are using a handful of its features     
 
o cryptography go lang projects ?  
  I wanted to understand the purpose behind having these microservices and the reason behind having them operating in an entirely separate independent environment such as container in the Dockerfile in each of these microservice directories . Are we trying to fetch  
PENDING PROJECT IDEAS above 2  
 
o cryptography projects in go lang  
o diwize or wiz studio (or both) had src download links(code with chai YT) see in project playlist  
o existing app folder architecutre similar to MVC design pattern ? Implement onion architecture in ur new code project  
  also look for other folder-file architectural optimizations   
o containerize existing applications by decompositing them into microServices so that they can independently deployable components   
o make those containerized application components interact with graphQL  
o look for reasons to incoroprate orchestrators like docker-compse or k8s  
o add payment gateway - strip  
o frontend from three.js may b (u did like react initally so may be angular )

mentor doubts  
I get check if the - the backend is running and is reachable   
Will I have to check render every day ? Because that is what's making my frontend on netlify to stop working ?  
Will I have to res-start it every time ? Should I use hostinger instead ??  
Should I use env MONGODB_URL value as mongodb port from Qkart in xflix too ?

o Assignment submission doubts for MERN-1 and MERN-2   
o name and region details for render website can be customized as per our will right ?  
o workspace files &&   qtrip dynamic deployment  
o Xflix frontend link (as seen in Qkart) since I want just the forntend otherwise the XfliX react too !!!       
o Bugs , Challenges , with respect to MANG  
o code editor ? or plain doc file 4 both LLD and DSA as seen in Google ?  
o Software for UML diagrams in machine coding rounds vs LLD rounds        
o HLD just as much taught ? The concepts (vast as such) behind solution of HLD questions as much taught during sprints nothing out of it right ?           
o Amazon leadership principles       

o resume XYZ formula    
o 1 || 2 || 3 Suf although assignements until 5   Cause if I complete then Questiosn of all diff are expectable    
o assignements of all DSA sprints unlocked    
o OOP questions or straight above ?      
o HLD 
o Finish assignements locally       
o sys design bar ---- raiser more CTC or we can pretty much achieve that from any bar raiser ?

o Apicontract available on books folder of drive   

LEARNT -  
o .env and package.json files are outside the backend or src folder 
o index.js uses the app exproted by the app.js file and points it to the port exposed by the config/config variable  
o roues>v1>index.js makes sure that route for which the concerned router is being called from here is not being repeated within the concerned router itself  
index.js router.use("/videos",videoRouter) -> video.routes.js router.post("/",videoController) // Don't keep it as /video again inside router file again  
 o app.use("*",routes) app.use("/v1",routes) is used inside app.js and router.GET/POST/PUT/  
o router>index.js file requires express too so that const router  = express.Router(); could be used and exported  
o Also index.js shall redirect requests to the routers present in the same folder  
o which means router.use("/route",exportedRouter) will be used not router.get/post   
o from controllers to services,routes and validations all will have an index.js file , 4 testing purposes and others 2 look for them   
o controllers have req,res whreas services have ApiError ? besides controllers cannot have catchAsync ?   
  
o information given to us in the ApiContract is what we use in the validations folder video.validator.js in order to create joi schemas   
videoUpload = joi.keys.object({   
  ratings : string , 
    genre : string, 
})    
BUT all the allowed values for these joi fields present in the Api Contract should be present in the config.js file in an abstracted manner   
const path = require("path");  
const dotenv = require("dotenv");  
dotenv.config({path: path.join(__dirname, "../../.env")});  
const GENRE_ACTION = "Action" ;  
const RATING_ANYONE = "Anyone";   
const RATING_7_PLUS = "7+";  
const RATING_ALL = "All";  
module.exports =  {  
  port : process.env.XFLIX_PORT,  
  genre_action : GENRE_ACTION,  
  mongoose:{  
    url:process.env.MONGODB_URL   
  }  
}  
o pay attention that when u are designing the schema for the response possibly the res.body then u need to include body in the defin :   
//goofedUp its not directly joi.keys.objects({}) instead its { body : joi.object().keys()} //forgot () of object  
//also its joi.string() not string alone without () we everything is a method/function since every nameis followed by ()   
const uploadVideo = {   
  body : joi.object().keys({   
    videoLink : joi.string().required(),   
    title : joi.string().required(),   
    genre : joi.string().required(),custom(genres),    
    contentRatings : joi.string().valid(...config,ratings),    
    releaseDate : joi.string(),required(),    
    previewImage : joi.string().required(),    
  })    
}    
  
o considering config.ratings -> in the config.js there's an ojbect exported as ratings : [RATINGS_ANYONE,RATINGS_7_PLUS,...,RATING_ALL]    
o httpStatus being used is not as customly crated file instead its the ALIAS for the imported/required  package ("htp-status")  
o utils >ApiError.js -> ApiError is indedd a class with Pascal casing extendign another class Error  
class ApiError extends Error{  
  constructor(statusCode,messge,isOperational= true , stack = ""){  
    super(message);  
    this.statusCode = statusCode;  
    this.isOperational = isOperational ;  
    if (stack){  
      this.stack = stack;  
    }else{  
      Error.captureStackTrace(this,this.constructor);  
    }  
  }  
}  
o utils>catchAsync.js has a function which takes a funcn (mind the name) as a parameter and returns it as a promise   
function catchAsync(funcn){  
    return function(req,res,next){  
     Promise.resolve(funcn(req,res,next)).catch((err) => next(err));  
    }  
}//export it now   
o What's the path the control logic follows with respect to Express applications ? controller then the routes ?? 
o utils/pick.js entire file itself Creating an object with picked object properties why {} at the second last line ? 
https://amnsingh.medium.com/whats-the-deal-with-object-prototype-hasownproperty-call-45bf8f8e1e83   
o validations>custom.validator.js trim() function ALSO if string.contains() then array.includes()   
o Also validate() being used in the concerned router(not index.js) is imported from middlewres not validators like this   
explanation ? two => in a row : const validate = (schema) => (req,res,next) => {} explanation   
o chekc the way exported elements from validators are being used in the same folder's video.validator.js 
o Also notive that videoValidator.js we are using custom(link) 4 getting videos and for upoloading videos the usage of custom.validator.js elements is different too  
o models folder has an index.js file too which redirectes requests to the exproted mongoose models   
const videoSchema = new mongoose.Schema({{},  {} , {} })//goofedUp the new keyword signifying that it is a mongoose schema instance   
o forogot the if the type of the field is string than it is presented as String     

LetZStore 
o mongoServer version is kept as 6

o We should have DDL querries in a sperate file other than the ones containing DML
